# Deep Learning & Streamlit Web App Project  

## Overview  
This repository contains two Python scripts:  
1. **`deeplearning_fp.py`** – A deep learning model implementation.  
2. **`streamlit_app.py`** – A Streamlit-based web application to interact with the model.  

## Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the scripts:  

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn streamlit


1. deeplearning_fp.py – Deep Learning Model
Features:

Implements a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras.
Handles data preprocessing and model training.
Supports evaluation and visualization of results.

TO expolre Run 
*** python deeplearning_fp.py ***

Note: Ensure that your dataset is available in the required directory before executing.



2. streamlit_app.py – Interactive Web Application
Features:

A Streamlit-based web app for interacting with the trained model.
Allows users to input data and get predictions.
Displays visualizations for better insights.

*** Start Streamlit app using:
streamlit run streamlit_app.py


This will launch a web interface in your browser where you can interact with the model.
